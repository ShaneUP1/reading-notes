# HTML and CSS
## Structure
- View Source is a really cool feature. It just seems surprising to me that it's so easy to see how the webpage was put together.
- comparing HTML sites to Word Docs is a good analogy and helpful to visualize.

## Extra Markup
- so happy they've simplified the doctype down to !DOCTYPE html
- comments have proven very helpful for me so far <!-- -->
- meta's live in the header
 - meta name = "description" is what search engines use to identify what the page is about
 - meta keywords no longer play a role in search engine optimization
 - I'm not sure why you would want a search engine to not add your page to a search engines results, but you'd use robots if so.

 ## HTML5 Layout
- use the new elements for their described purposes, otherwise use div's when no other option
- HTML5 shiv or shim must be used to help older browsers know the new HTML5 elements

## Process and Design
- when making a site begin with: who, why, what the site is for
 - who are you marketing towards (age, demographics, location, etc.)
 - why are they coming to your site
 - what are they trying to achieve and what information do they need to do so
 - also consider how often so you know how often the site should be updated
- sitemaps like wireframe help when trying to layout a site before making all the elements, pages, etc.
- the idea behind design is communication
 - what content should be upfront
 - what content should be emphasized
 - how should it be grouped together to achieve its purpose
 - different styles of grouping can make designs easier to understand
- be consistent in your design through your site to minimize confusion

# Javascript

## Intro
- JS allows us to make pages more interactive
 - through accessing content, modifying content, setting processes, and reacting

## The ABC of Programming
- scripts are sets of instruction
 - we first need to know our goal
 - split up the goal into the smallest manageable steps
 - code each step
- flowcharts are like the wireframes of scripts, they help us to visualize the steps we need to complete
- objects have properties(names and values)
- an event is how we interact with objects
- methods are what people do with the objects
- HTML forms the structure, CSS forms the style and JS forms the behavior
